# Instagram Challenge

This is a clone of the Instagram social media platform, using Ruby on Rails. It was completed over a weekend as part of the intensive 
Makers Academy software development course.

User Stories:
-------------
I have written these to allow use of an agile TDD (solo) approach and to identify an MVP:
```
As a user
In order to enjoy spare moments
I want to see photos that interest me

As a user
I want to share photos of my life
So that others can see what I'm doing

As a user
I want to see photos of people I'm interested in
To know what they're doing

As a user
I want my friends to be able to connect with me
So that they can see my photos

As a user
I want to connect with others
So that I can see their photos

As a user
I want to delete a photo I've posted
If I no longer like it

As a user
I want followers to be able to comment on my photos
So that I know what they think about them

As a user
I want followers to be able to like my photos
So that I know which are popular

As a user
I want be to able to like photos
So that I can let others know if I like them
